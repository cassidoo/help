Highlighting while reading has enormous benefits.
It helps you engage more deeply with the text, comprehend dense subjects, and easily revisit key passages in the future.

You can create highlights in Raindrop.io [Browser extension](../../getting-started/install-extension/index.md), [Desktop](https://raindrop.io/download), [Web](https://app.raindrop.io) and Mobile app (soon).

:::note
Highlighting is available for all users. There's no limit on total number of pages and highlights.  
But notes for highlights (annotations) is [premium feature](../../billing/premium-features.md).

## FAQ
### Why you need additional browser extension permission? {#extension-permission}
To be able to see highlights next time you visit same page we need additional permission called `Access browser tabs`.
This permission gives a specific extension ability to know URL of visited web-page.
Don't worry we not track you or send this info to third-parties. This info only used to load saved highlights to specific web-page.

Many extensions have this permission by default. But not ours. We decided to ask you explicitly.
